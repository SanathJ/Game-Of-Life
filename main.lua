    Breakout Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden
    cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

    Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
    Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
    player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
    with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
    values by deflecting a ball back at them.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

    Conway's Game Of Life

    Author: Sanath Jathanna

    The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
    devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a 
    zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial
    state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by
    creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
    about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
    `h` variable representing width and height, respectively.

    A callback that processes key strokes as they happen, just the once.
    Does not account for keys that are held down, which is handled by a
    separate function (`love.keyboard.isDown`). Useful for when we want
    things to happen right away, just once, like when we want to quit.

    A custom function that will let us test for individual keystrokes outside
    of the default `love.keypressed` callback, since we can't call that logic
    elsewhere by default.
